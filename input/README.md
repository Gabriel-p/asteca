The `CLUSTER.DAT` file contains a synthetic open cluster generated
via the [MASSCLEAN][1] package with the following parameter values:

- z = 0.008
- log(age) = 8.0
- E(B-V) = 032 (Av = 1.0)
- (m-M)o = 12.32 (d = 3 kpc)

and serves as an example cluster to be analyzed with **ASteCA**.

This file can be safely deleted.
