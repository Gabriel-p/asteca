def gen_algor():
    '''
    Genetic algorithm adapted to find the best fit model-obervation.
    '''
    
    # Translate space of all possible solutions to binary format.
    
    # Pick N solutions (genotypes/chromosomes) at random
    
    
    ### Evaluation/fitness ###
    
    # Evaluate the N random chromosomes in the evaluation/objective function
    # (likelihood)
    
    # Calculate fitness value for each chromosome.
    
    
    #### Selection ###
    # Generate CDF for the chromosome's probability distribution (fitness).
    
    # Select N chromosomes for breeding from the CDF to generate the
    # intermediate population.
    
    
    #### Breeding ### 
    
    # Apply crossover operation on random chromosomes.
    
    # Apply mutation operation on random chromosomes.
    
    
    ### Decoding###
    
    # Translate binary form to normal naming to process this new generation.
