#
# NAME: Cluster's name.
# c_x:  Cluster's x center coordinate in pixels.
# c_y:  Cluster's y center coordinate in pixels.
# rad:  Cluster's radius in pixels.
# f_regs: Number of field regions to obtain around the cluster.
#
#
# MC:   Manual center flag.
#       '0': Disabled, center will be searched automatically.
#       '1': The coordinates given will be used as initial approximate values
#       for the cluster's true central coordinates. The latter will be searched
#       inside the radius given in the 'rad' parameter.
#       '2': Value is fixed to what is given here.
#
# MR:   Radius value flag.
#       '0': Disabled, radius will be searched automatically.
#       '1': The radius for the cluster will be taken from the 'rad' value.
#
# MF:  Manual field regions flag.
#      '0': Disabled, field regions number will be obtained from the
#      'params_input.dat' file.
#      '1': The number of field regions will be taken from the 'f_regs' value.
