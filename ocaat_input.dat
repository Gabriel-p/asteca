##### OCAAT input parameters file ####
#
#
# This file contains the values of the parameters used by OCAAT.
# Any empty line and lines that begin with a # sign will be ignored
# and as many as needed can be added to this file.
#
# * DO NOT modify the ID strings in the first column of each line, these
# are used by the code to identify the parameters in that line.
# * DO NOT write less or more values than those requested or the code
# will halt.

# Set values for the parameters below.

# Mode used to run the code: a (auto) / s (semi) / m (manual):
# - Automatic mode does not require user intervention of any kind.
# - Semi takes it input values from the 'clusters_input.dat' file.
# - Manual mode will ask for some values (center, radius, background) but
#   will also give you the chance to have them automatically calculated.

# runs: auto / manual, the number of times the cluster-field regions will be

# - If 'auto' is set the code will use the number of runs 'runs' and the number
# of Monte Carlo samples 'mc_samp' as defined internally (ie: 100/(areas-1)
# and 1000 respectively)
# - If 'manual' is set these two values are taken from this file (below),
# otherwise the values are irrelevant.
# - If 'read' is set the code will attempt to read the probabilities from
# an existing file. This file should have the same format as the output
# '*_memb.dat' file created by the code and should be located in the folder
# defined by the ID 'CP0' above.
# - If 'skip' is selected all stars will be assigned an equal probability
# of 1. and the algorithm skipped altogether.
