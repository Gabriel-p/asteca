##### OCAAT input parameters file ####
#
#
# This file contains the values of the parameters used by OCAAT.
# Any empty line or lines that begin with a # character will be ignored
# and as many as needed can be added to this file.
#
# The blocks can be moved around as the user sees fit.
#
# * DO NOT modify the ID strings in the first column of each line, these
# are used by the code to identify the parameters in that line.
# * DO NOT write less or more values than those requested in each line
# or the code will halt.

# Set parameters values below.

# Mode used to run the code: a (auto) / s (semi) / m (manual):
# - Automatic mode does not require user intervention of any kind.
# - Semi takes it input values from the 'clusters_input.dat' file.
# - Manual mode will ask for some values (center, radius, background) but
#   will also give you the chance to have them automatically calculated.
