The following files:

- params_input.dat
- sem_input.dat

are examples of working input files and can be copied or moved
to the root folder (where `asteca.py` is located) to be read by
the code.

The CLUSTER.DAT file located inside the `/input` folder, contains 
a synthetic open cluster generated via the [MASSCLEAN][1] package
with the following parameter values:

- z=
- log(age)=
- E(B-V)=
- (m-M)o=

and serves as an example cluster to be analyzed with ASteCA.
