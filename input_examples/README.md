The following files:

- params_input.dat
- sem_input.dat

are examples of working input files and can be copied or moved
into an existing `/input` folder to be read by the code.

The CLUSTER.DAT file contains a synthetic open cluster
generated via the [MASSCLEAN][1] package with the following
parameter values:

- z=
- log(age)=
- E(B-V)=
- (m-M)o=

and serves as an example cluster to be analyzed with ASteCA.

This entire folder can be also renamed to `/input` if one does not
already exist.
